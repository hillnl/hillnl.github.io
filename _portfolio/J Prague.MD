## Overall
Overall rating: 7/10. I loved this city! It was so cute and fairy tale-like, all the buildings were pastel and with beautiful architecture. We spent less than 24 hours here though, so I just don’t think we got to take advantage of it. I liked this city more than Budapest, but I liked the activities we did in Budapest more!

## Activities
* Prague Castle Tower: it’s free to visit Prague Castle, which is a really pretty area, but my favorite part was climbing up the tower! You need to buy a ticket for it but it’s super cheap and definitely worth it. After climbing a bunch of stairs, you get an amazing view of the whole city!

## Restaurants
* The Alchemist: fun speakeasy bar with cool drinks. There was a line to get seats though. 
* Bistro Monk: really good breakfast place. Beware there might be a line if you go later though. There was a line and we went at like 9:30 am. 

## Hostel
* The Best Spot Hostel: we stayed in a private five person room that was pretty small with communal bathrooms. It wasn’t the best hostel but it was cheap, a great location, and worked well since we weren’t in Prague for very long. I wouldn't have wanted to stay there for more than one night though.
