## Overall
Overall rating: 8/10. I really liked Rome because it’s so full of history! You walk around, and there are modern buildings right next to ruins and ancient monuments. There’s also just so so much to see. With that being said, I prefer the hikes and boat days in Sorrento to the museum visits in Rome, but that’s my personal preference! And it made me appreciate Madrid’s awesome public transportation.

## Activities
* Tour of the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill: do a guided tour!! We were debating just walking around, but it’s so worth it to spend a little more and get all the history. We booked our tour through GetYourGuide, and it was awesome! The tour guide was so passionate about it and made it so fun!
* Tour of the Vatican Museums, Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter’s basilica: I would also recommend doing a guided tour for all of these because you get to skip the line. The history is so interesting, and I feel like the tour keeps you moving at a good pace. St. Peter’s Basilica ended up being closed when we went, so make sure to be aware of that when booking tours. The Vatican museum and Sistine Chapel were incredible, and it was really cool to see all the beautiful architecture and art everywhere!
  * Something to note for the Vatican and some other museums: dress conservatively. There are dress codes for some of these so make sure you are covered up if you need to be.
* Piazza Venecia: you can go to the roof of this building to get an incredible 360 view of Rome! Our hostel owner told us about it, and I’m so glad he did. 
* Trevi Fountain: classic tourist spot. It’s always pretty busy, but I think it’s worth it to walk by!
* Pantheon: another classic tourist spot, but we didn’t have enough time to see it. 

## Restaurants
* Da Romolo alla Mole Adriana: Italian restaurant. One of my dad’s friends, who has lived in Rome all his life, recommended this place for a true Italian place, and it was great! The cacio e pepe pasta was really good. 

## Hostel
* Funny Palace Hostel: even though this hostel isn’t in the center of the city, it ended up being a great location because it was really close to a train station and metro. The train station was perfect for coming from Sorrento and going to Florence, and using the metro was really easy for getting to the tourist attractions. We also got a private three person room that was cheap and decent. Not the nicest hostel we’ve been in, but the location was worth it!

## Transportation
* Rome has two metro lines, and the buses are slow and unreliable. The city is also super spread out so it’s hard to walk around and cover all the sites. Make sure to choose well where you stay! Fun fact though: apparently the city wants to build more metro lines, but every time they dig underground, they find more Roman artifacts and have to stop construction. 

## Other
* If you do guided tours, book them in advance!! Especially during spring break and Easter week because it will be super busy then.
