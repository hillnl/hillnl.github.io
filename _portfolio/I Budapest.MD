## Overall
Overall rating: 7/10. The activities we did were so fun, and the food was good and cheap! The city itself wasn’t my favorite but I still really liked this trip! We spent 2 days there and then flew to Prague which worked out well for a long weekend trip.

## Activities
* Prosecco boat tour: my favorite part of the trip!! Highly recommend! We booked through BudaBest, and it’s a 75 min boat ride with unlimited Prosecco. You float on the Danube River and get to see the Parliament building lit up. Make sure to time it correctly because you want to go at night and see the building lit up, but in the winter they turn off those lights at 10 pm, so make sure to plan it for when it’s dark but early enough so the lights are still on. If you have a digital camera, bring it! Those were some of my favorite pictures we got.

* Szimpla Kert: famous ruins bar, very cool, definitely worth going! Less of a clubbing vibe, but I think it’s a great start to the night!

* Gellert thermal baths: we did the thermal baths at the Gellert Hotel. It was a little more expensive but honestly worth it cause it felt less busy and less gross haha! Not my favorite activity we did in Budapest, but it felt like a must while we were there cause Budapest is famous for its baths. There’s another bath that is more famous, but I’ve heard it’s also just more crowded and not as clean.

* Fisherman’s Bastion and Buda Castle: the main tourist attraction in Budapest, and it was so worth it to walk around! You can take a funicular up to the top and then walk around, or take a golf cart tour that has four or five stops. We did the golf cart tour, and it was perfect because we walked around for a while at each stop and then got in line for the next available golf cart

## Restaurants
* Frici Papa: really good and cheap Hungarian restaurant. I got the chicken breast paprikash and it was so good (and our uber driver recommended it too)! Expect a line to get in if it’s during lunch or dinner hour though or make a reservation beforehand. It’s a very popular restaurant.

* Gizi Gastro Bar: really good brunch place, 5 min walk from St. Stephen’s Basilica, the eggs Benedict were amazing and pretty cheap! Really fun to get brunch here and then check out the basilica. 

* Trattoria Venezia: amazing Italian place we found close to our hostel! The burrata was the best we have all ever had! Definitely on the more expensive side, but it was so worth it. Might need a reservation though.

## Hostel
* Maverick Urban Lodge Hostel: we stayed in private rooms, so it felt more like a hotel than a hostel, which was nice. They also had a bar near the lobby and activities each night, so we got to do karaoke, and that was so fun! Felt like a young crowd which was nice.

## Transportation
* Mostly just walked everywhere or used uber or bolt because they were pretty cheap.

## Other
* The city of Budapest is divided by the Danube River into the Buda and Pest districts. The Buda district is more historic and the Pest district is younger and where the nightlife is, so plan accordingly on where you want to stay.
