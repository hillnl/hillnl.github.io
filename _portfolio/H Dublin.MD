## Overall
Overall rating: 7/10. I went for St. Patrick’s Day, and it was really fun!! Dublin during St. Patty’s with a bunch of your friends is such a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I’m really glad I went, but it wasn’t my favorite trip. The flights and airbnb were so expensive, and Dublin itself wasn’t my favorite city. I liked the pubs, the cliffs, and the easy transportation, but I’m in no rush to go back. 


## Activities
* Cliffs of Howth: beautiful walk along the cliffs with gorgeous views and the beach below. About an hour away from Dublin, but there’s a bus that takes you to Howrh and then another bus that takes you right to the start of the walk. This was definitely one of my favorite parts of the weekend!

* Diceys: main bar that most Vandy people go to for St. Patty’s day. It’s huge and has a big outdoor area and a ton of indoor areas. Make sure to get your tickets at least a month before because they will sell out. So worth it though and so fun to see a bunch of Vandy friends!

* St. Pattrick’s Day Parade: one of the biggest parades in the world! It’s two hours long and had so many random parades but it was really cool to see.

* Guinness Factory: really popular tourist attraction. You get a tour of the Guinness factory and then get a complimentary Guinness on the roof of the building. We didn’t do it but I kinda wish we had. Make sure to buy tickets beforehand!

* Pubs on Camden Street: we didn’t have tickets to Dicey’s on Saturday, so we ended up bar hopping, and it was really fun. We got to see a lot of bars with different vibes, and it was a lot less busy than the Temple Bar area. 

* National Gallery of Ireland: free, pretty big, and has really pretty art!

## Restaurants
* POG: good brunch spot. 

## Transportation
* Public transportation was actually awesome! We were worried it’d be bad during St. Patty’s weekend, but it was super convenient and cheap. We bought a three day pass for the buses which was perfect.
* The Luas is the light rail for the city of dublin. You can buy a ticket at any stop. Make sure to buy a ticket!! They regularly check, and the ticket is only a couple Euros. If they catch you, it's a 100 euro charge. 
* The Dart is the commuter rail that can take you to communities around Dublin. It is a cheap ticket that can be bought at the station. This will be good for seaside towns around Dublin (like Howth, Bray, Bull Island).
Download the FreeNow app, which lets you call a taxi. You can use uber, but it’s just the taxi drivers, and you’ll have to wait longer since all taxi drivers are on FreeNow and not all are on uber. Didn’t use this much but it’s helpful to have just in case. 
* Dublin Express or Aircoach.ie provide easy and cheap transport between the airport and city center.

## Other
* You need a UK converter to plug into walls, not an EU one.
