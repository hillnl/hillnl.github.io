## Overall
Overall rating: 7/10. I loved this trip, and it was nice to start study abroad with an easy train ride. The Alhambra is spectacular, and it was super fun to walk around and explore. If you aren’t studying abroad in Spain though, I think there are better places to visit, but I still loved it! Other than the Alhambra, there’s not that much to do, so we only spent 2 full days there. 

## Activities
* Alhambra: a huge palace and fortress with amazing architecture and beautiful gardens, and the main attraction of Granada. Definitely leave a whole day to explore it and book your ticket before traveling there because sometimes they sell out. It was beautiful!

* Flamenco show: we booked a flamenco show at night and it was super fun!

* Miradores: There’s a circular(ish) route around the city you can take going to different miradores (viewpoints) where you go higher up and get super pretty views. Our airbnb host recommended it and it was a great way to spend the day.

## Restaurants
* Tapas bar crawl: most tapas restaurants in Granada give you a free tapa when you order a drink, so it’s fun to go to a bunch of different places and try all the tapas! Also though, the more drinks you buy at one place, the better the tapas you will get. 

## Transportation
* We took a train from Madrid to get here, which was super easy, and then walked everywhere in Granada or ubered if needed.
