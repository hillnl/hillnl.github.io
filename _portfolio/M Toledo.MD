## Overall
Overall rating: 6/10. We took a train from Madrid and spent like 5 hours there, and it was cool, but I wouldn’t spend more than a day there. The history of Toledo is so interesting (a city where Muslim, Christianity, and Judaism have all co-existed). I think it would have been worth it to do a guided tour so that we could have learned about it while walking around! 

## Activities
* Museo del Queso Manchego: we did a manchego cheese tasting here and it was great! They give you three types of manchego cheese and explain the difference in each and the history. They also have a little museum exhibit thing that you can explore for free (it’s like 3 tiny little rooms though).

* Iglesia de San Ildefonso: church with two towers that you can climb that have a really pretty view of Toledo! It costs 4 euros to get up, but I think it’s definitely worth it.

## Transportation
* We took the renfe train from Madrid. It takes 30 min, but book a little bit in advance because they will sell out. Otherwise, there's a free bus you can take but it takes longer.
