## Overall
Overall rating: 7/10. We only did a day trip to Florence, so it was pretty fast, but it felt very American and touristy. It is such a pretty city though, and it was the starting point of the Renaissance, so it has a ton of really cool art and museums. The city is also super walkable and smaller than I thought, which was nice for a day trip. And I got the best gelato ever there (I can’t remember where exactly but there’s so many gelato shops)!

## Activities
* Sunset at Piazzale Michelangelo: a pretty square that overlooks the whole city. It was really crowded for the sunset, but it was a beautiful view and worth it!

* Boboli Gardens: really big park that was fun to explore and relax in. You do have to pay to get in though.

* Ponte Vecchio: bridge that crosses the river and has a ton of jewelry shops. It was really cool to walk around and look at all the jewelry, and it was a pretty view over the river.

* Duomo de Florence: a really big and pretty church with cool architecture. This is probably the biggest attraction in Florence, so I would recommend getting tickets ahead of time if you want to go inside. There was a really long line when we went, so we ended up just walking around outside.

* Uffizi: one of the most famous Italian museums that holds a lot of art from the Italian Renaissance. We didn’t end up going in, but I’ve heard good things about it!

* The Accademia: another art gallery. Its most famous painting is the David statue.

## Restaurants
* All’Antico Vinaio: famous sandwich shop that was really good! 

## Transportation
* The city is so walkable!
